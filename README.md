# EA-Clustering

This repository contains the evidence accumulation framework implemented for unsupervised learning. The framework is independent of the clustering methodology used. For demonstration purposes K-means++ algorithm is implemented and used as the clustering methodology.

Thi file contains Evidence Accumulation based clustering algorithm as described in (Fred & Jain, 2005).
